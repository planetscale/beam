      set out in Section 4.\n\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content
      (images,\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand
      so this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not\nthe contents
      of the Database individually. Licensors may therefore wish\nto use this license
      together with another license for the contents.\n\nSometimes the contents of a
      database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed
      here (such as private contracts,\ntrademark over the name, or privacy rights /
      data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised
      that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities

      include the plural and vice versa.\n\n### 2.0 What this License covers\n\n2.1.
      Legal effect of this document. This License is:\n\n  a. A license of applicable
      copyright and neighbouring rights;\n\n  b. A license of the Database Right; and\n\n
      \ c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\n\n2.2 Legal rights
      covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\nDatabase, including:\n\n
      \ a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\n  The copyright
      licensed includes any individual elements of the\n  Database, but does not cover
      the copyright over the Contents\n  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4
      for details. Copyright\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover:
      the Database\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\n
      \ of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\n  indexes;
      the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\n  Contents stored in
      the Database;\n\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction
      and\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\n  Database
      Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\n  Database. Database
      Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\n  from the Database and are
      selected and arranged in a way that would\n  not infringe any applicable copyright;
      and\n\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\n
      \ access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\n  use
      on this access as outlined in this License. \n\n2.3 Rights not covered. \n\n  a.
      This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\n  or operation
      of the Database; \n\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents
      or the\n  Database; and\n\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated
      with the\n  Database. \n\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual
      items of\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\nincluding
      copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\nrights, and this
      License does not cover any rights (other than Database\nRights or in contract)
      in individual Contents contained in the Database.\nFor example, if used on a Database
      of images (the Contents), this\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual
      images, which could\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering
      all of\nthe rights over the images.  \n\n### 3.0 Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject
      to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\ngrants to You a worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\nonly under Section 9) license to
      Use the Database for the duration of\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights.
      These rights explicitly\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field
      of endeavour. To\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights
      may be\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\nfuture.
      \n\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\n\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation
      of the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents;\n\n  b. Creation of Derivative
      Databases;\n\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\n\n  d. Creation of temporary
      or permanent reproductions by any means and\n  in any form, in whole or in part,
      including of any Derivative\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases;
      and\n\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\n
      \ performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\n  part,
      including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\n  Databases.\n\n3.2
      Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory
      license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties
      through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
      Licensor reserves\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
      by You\n  of the rights granted under this License;\n\n  b. Waivable compulsory
      license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties
      through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor
      waives the\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
      of\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n  c. Voluntary license schemes.
      The Licensor waives the right to collect\n  royalties, whether individually or,
      in the event that the Licensor is\n  a member of a collecting society that administers
      voluntary licensing\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
      the rights\n  granted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release the Database
      under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available the Database,
      is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may
      have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\n10.4,
      all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\n\n### 4.0 Conditions
      of Use\n\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject
      to\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\nconditions
      of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\nin material breach
      of its terms.\n\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\nDatabase,
      or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\nmust: \n\n  a. Do
      so only under the terms of this License;\n\n  b. Include a copy of this License
      or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n  with the Database or Derivative Database,
      including both in the\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation;
      \n\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\n  that
      refer to this License; and\n\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices
      in a particular\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices
      in a\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\n
      \ look for it.\n\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a
      Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly
      Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work
      reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts
      with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained
      from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective
      Database, and that it\nis available under this License.\n\n  a. Example notice.
      The following text will satisfy notice under\n  Section 4.3:\n\n        Contains
      information from DATABASE NAME which is made available\n        under the ODC
      Attribution License.\n\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the
      Database and a\nhyperlink to the location of the Database. \"ODC Attribution License\"\nshould
      contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\nhyperlinks are
      not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI's with the
      above notice.\n\n4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database.
      Each time\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents,
      or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to
      the recipient a license to the Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this
      License. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with
      this License, but You may\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative
      Database. You are\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database
      made\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\nfurther
      restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.\n\n###
      5.0 Moral rights\n\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including
      any rights\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\nthat
      would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\nany other derogatory
      treatment:\n\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor
      waives\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\n
      \ extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n  10.4;
      \n\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\n  jurisdiction
      is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\n  rights over the Database
      and waives all claims in moral rights to the\n  fullest extent possible by the
      law of the relevant jurisdiction under\n  Section 10.4; and\n\n  c. For jurisdictions
      not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\n  moral rights under Section
      5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\n  moral rights over certain aspects
      of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver
      of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.\n\n###
      6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \n\n6.1 This
      License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently
      have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without
      limitation:\n\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of
      Contents\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\n
      \ purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\n  Extraction
      or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\n  or judicial procedure.
      \n\n  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation\n
      \ or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \n\n6.2
      This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract\nand Re-utilise
      insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated\nquantitatively or qualitatively,
      for any purposes whatsoever, including\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject
      to other rights over the\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic
      Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however
      amount\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\nContents.\n\n###
      7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor
      \"as is\" and without any\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising
      by statute,\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically\ndisclaims
      any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,\nnon-infringement, accuracy
      or completeness, the presence or absence of\nerrors, fitness for a particular
      purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
      of implied warranties, so\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.\n\n### 8.0 Limitation
      of liability\n\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited
      by law,\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability\nfor
      loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use\nunder this License,
      whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused\nby any fault on the part
      of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of\nliability includes, but is not limited
      to, any special, incidental,\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such
      as loss of revenue,\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion
      applies\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n8.2
      If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and\ndirect financial
      loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on\nthe part of the Licensor.\n\n###
      9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\n\n9.1 Any breach by You of
      the terms and conditions of this License\nautomatically terminates this License
      with immediate effect and without\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt,
      Persons who have received the\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the
      Contents, Derivative\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database
      from You\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\ntheir
      use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\nunder Section
      4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will\nsurvive any termination
      of this License.\n\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License,
      the Licensor\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \n\n9.3 Unless terminated
      under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You\nfor the duration of applicable
      rights in the Database. \n\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach
      of the terms and\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this
      License\nwill be reinstated:\n\n  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination
      until the 60th\n  day after cessation of breach; \n\n  b. Permanently on the 60th
      day after cessation of breach unless\n  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor;
      or\n\n  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the\n  violation,
      this is the first time You have received notice of\n  violation of this License
      from  the Licensor, and You cure the\n  violation prior to 30 days after your
      receipt of the notice.\n\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing
      or\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different\nlicense
      terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not\nwithdraw this License
      (or any other license that has been, or is\nrequired to be, granted under the
      terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect
      unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n### 10.0 General\n\n10.1 If any provision
      of this License is held to be invalid or\nunenforceable, that must not affect
      the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of
      this License and each\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and
      enforced to the\nfullest extent permitted by law. \n\n10.2 This License is the
      entire agreement between the parties with\nrespect to the rights granted here
      over the Database. It replaces any\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations
      with respect to\nthe Database. \n\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this
      License, You will not be\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to
      complain of any\nbreach by the Licensor. \n\n10.4 Choice of law. This License
      takes effect in and will be governed by\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction
      in which the License terms are\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of
      rights granted under\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant\njurisdiction
      includes additional rights not granted under this License,\nthese additional rights
      are granted in this License in order to meet the\nterms of this License.\n"
